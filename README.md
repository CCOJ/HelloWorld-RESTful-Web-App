My first RESTful Service Application that demonstrates a basic HelloWorld program

"HelloWorld/build/libs/" for an executable .jar file

"HelloWorld/src/main/java/hello/" for .java source files

After running the executable .jar, enter into your address bar: http://localhost:8080/greeting 

To modify the name (replaces "World" in "Hello, World!") , replace "insertNameHere" with desired name: http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=insertNameHere
